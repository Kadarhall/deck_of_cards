## Deck o' Cards

1. Make `deck_o_cards` assemble an array of cards using the provided *suits* and *values* arrays. Each card in the deck should be a hash formatted as:
	* `{suit: 'hearts', value: 'A'}`
2. Make `deck_o_cards` return a shuffled array of cards.
3. Call `deck_o_cards`, then print the following:
	* **"The deck has {n} cards"**
	* **"The top card is the {value} of {suit}"**
